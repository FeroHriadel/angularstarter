# ANGULAR STARTER

This project is a cheat sheet on how to use Angular. 
It's frontend for this aws serverless api: https://github.com/FeroHriadel/serverlessstarter.git

It shows how to use:
- service
- ngrx
- modules
- angular material
- push images to backend
- interceptor
- routeguard
- environment variables

While not entirely complete, I believe it's a solid overview on Angular usage.
